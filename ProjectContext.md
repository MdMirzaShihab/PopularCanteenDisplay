# Canteen Management Software - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

We are developing a comprehensive **Canteen Management Software** that revolutionizes how restaurants and cafeterias manage their menus and communicate offerings to customers. The system features digital display screens that automatically update throughout the day based on pre-configured schedules, eliminating manual menu changes and ensuring customers always see current offerings.

**Project Timeline:** 8-9 weeks  
**Technology Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)  
**Target Users:** Restaurant managers, cafeteria operators, institutional food services

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Challenges in Canteen Operations:

1. **Manual Menu Management:** Staff must physically change menu boards or printed materials multiple times daily for breakfast, lunch, dinner services
2. **Inconsistent Information:** Customers often see outdated menu information, leading to confusion and poor experience
3. **Time-Consuming Updates:** Changing prices, adding new items, or updating descriptions requires reprinting materials
4. **Limited Flexibility:** Difficult to run time-based promotions or special menus for different periods
5. **No Activity Tracking:** No way to audit who made changes to menus or when updates occurred

### Business Impact:

- **Lost Revenue:** Outdated menus mean customers don't see new items or current prices
- **Staff Time Waste:** Employees spend hours weekly updating physical menus
- **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Confusion over what's available leads to poor experience
- **Operational Inefficiency:** No centralized system for managing food offerings

## Our Solution

### Digital Canteen Management System

A web-based platform that allows restaurant staff to:

1. **Centrally Manage Food Items** - Add, edit, and organize menu items with photos, descriptions, and pricing
2. **Create Dynamic Menus** - Build different menus for various meal periods (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Specials)
3. **Schedule Automatically** - Set time-based rules so menus change automatically throughout the day
4. **Display Beautifully** - Show menus on digital screens (TVs, monitors, tablets) with professional layouts
5. **Track All Changes** - Complete audit trail of who changed what and when
